          Seamful is a project application developed by Kristina Tong,
          Madeleine Tabing, Arielle Ramirez, and Forrest Benton. Principally,
          this application is a demonstration of the Ruby on Rails experience
          and knowledge that we, Flatiron School students, have acquired up until
          the release of this app.
